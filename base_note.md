### Final Project Ideas
- Idea one: finetune BloombergGPT on Saudi Market, and use it to help in stock advice or to chat with the markt.

- **Idea two:** 
> An Open Source Tool as a Foundation and Future SaaS Project
The project aims to simplify the process of designing customized models for companies or individual projects.
#### Features:
- Model Selection: Users can choose the model that best suits their needs.
- Database Integration: Users can connect the model to their preferred database.
- Conversation Style: Users can select the desired conversation method for the model.
- Vector Database Connection: Users can integrate the model with their chosen vector database.
- Interaction Style: Users can define the style in which the model interacts.
- Tool Integration: Users can connect the model with various tools, such as:
    - Web browser
    - Python, etc.
- Fine-Tuning: Users can fine-tune the model for specific requirements.
- User Interface Selection: Users can choose the user interface for the program.
- Easy Integration: Users can easily integrate the model into their application.
